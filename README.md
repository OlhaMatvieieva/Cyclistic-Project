# Cyclistic Analysis (bike-share program) ðŸš´
## Project Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone and focuses on analyzing data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal is to explore how casual riders and annual members use the bike-share system differently, in order to help the company design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Business Task
The director of marketing at Cyclistic has identified that maximizing the number of annual memberships is critical to the companyâ€™s future growth. The key objective is to understand the differences in bike usage patterns between casual riders (those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) and annual members. Insights from this analysis will inform strategies aimed at encouraging casual riders to become annual members.

## Key Objectives
**1. Analyze User Behavior:** Identify how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
**2. Support Marketing Strategy:** Use the findings to design targeted marketing campaigns that encourage casual riders to become members.
**3. Deliver Data-Backed Recommendations:** Ensure that the marketing strategies are backed by solid data and visualizations for executive approval.
## Data Source
The analysis uses 12 months of historical trip data from Cyclistic, which includes information on trip duration, start and end times, bike types, and user categories (casual or member). The data is anonymized to protect rider privacy and was provided under a license from Motivate International Inc..

## Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The director of marketing has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently?
