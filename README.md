**Cyclistic Analysis (bike-share program)**
In this project I am work as a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago. My task is to analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Based on this, my team will develop a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
